3D_Hospital
The "A 3D Hospital" project is a computer graphics application which is designed using OpenGL to simulate a realistic hospital area environment. This project merges visual aesthetics with user interactivity to create an immersive experience. By leveraging advanced graphics techniques such as dynamic lighting, detailed texturing, and animated object motion, the simulation offers a lifelike and engaging representation of the space. Additionally, it features a virtual model of a hospital cabin room and diagnosis area where users can navigate the environment, interact with the space, and modify settings like lighting and camera perspectives.
